## ***Two Sum***
### Description
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

### Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
### My Solution In Java
```
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        int[] res = new int[2];
        for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i++){
            for(int j=i+1;j<nums.length;j++){
                if(nums[i]+nums[j] == target){
                    res[0] = i;
                    res[1] = j;
                    return res;
                }
            }
        }
        throw new RuntimeException("no suitable elements for given target!");
    }
}
```
### Analyse
my solution is simple,exactly same idea with [Approach 1: Brute Force] in  the [Solution Tab] given by leecode,just loop through each element xx and find if there is another value that equals to (target-x).
I found that there are more effiective ways to solve this problem by introducing a hash table, the hash table maintains a mapping of each element in the array to its index,which can reduce the look up time from O(n) to O(1) by trading space for speed.Here is the code,which is more effictive than my solution,especialy when the array is large.
```
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("No two sum solution");
}
```

### ***My Review***
```
The artical has 4 outstanding subtitles supporting the artical's goal,for instance, 
"Not every code is worth writing",
"Not every bug is worth fixing",
"Not every command is worth scripting",
"Not every feature is worth coding".
Through the author's exeprience and thinking,
he tells the develper that his purpose and 
the purpose of the code he write is to generate value and make the existing world a better place, 
not to satisfy your egocentric view of what the world should be.

# ***Tip***
I tried to insert some  data to Oracle database through JDBC last week,I use the MYSQL jdbc driver in my code by mistake,the driver jar and the driver name was related to  MYSQL,not Oracle.
Surprisingly,the code with the wrong driver worked fine with the CRUD action!I googled on the Internet found no such case as mine.I think I can only figured out the reason after I read the orginal code of mysql jdbc driver and the oracle jdbc driver.
# ***Share***
Last week I was preparing a technology sharing in my company.It's about an OLAP Engine for big data called Apache Kylin.I recorded my sharing procedure  serval times after work after the sharing,finally,a 104 minutes' video sharing was done.I uploaded the recorded video to baiduyunpan, Here is the video made by myself,making it public so that anyone interested in this can feel free to watch and download it.Any questions about this sharing are invited.
