# ***Algorithm***
## ***Two Sum***
### Description
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

### Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
### My Solution In Java
```
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        int[] res = new int[2];
        for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i++){
            for(int j=i+1;j<nums.length;j++){
                if(nums[i]+nums[j] == target){
                    res[0] = i;
                    res[1] = j;
                    return res;
                }
            }
        }
        throw new RuntimeException("no suitable elements for given target!");
    }
}
```
### Analyse
my solution is simple,exactly same idea with [Approach 1: Brute Force] in  the [Solution Tab] given by leecode,just loop through each element xx and find if there is another value that equals to (target-x).
I found that there are more effiective ways to solve this problem by introducing a hash table, the hash table maintains a mapping of each element in the array to its index,which can reduce the look up time from O(n) to O(1) by trading space for speed.Here is the code,which is more effictive than my solution,especialy when the array is large.
```
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("No two sum solution");
}
```

### ***My Review***
```
The author suggest that java developer use Kotlin in the next project,
because he think It’s pragmatic and concise, and makes coding a satisfying and efficient experience.
And it has the following feathers compare to java:
0# ***Java Interoperability*** Kotlin is 100% interoperable with Java，all your favorite Java frameworks are still available.
1# ***Familiar Syntax***  Its syntax is familiar to any programmer coming from the OOP domain.
2# ***String Interpolation***  A smarter and more readable version of Java’s String.format().
3# ***Type Inference***   Kotlin will infer your types。
4# ***Smart Casts***    The Kotlin compiler tracks your logic and auto-casts types if possible.
5# ***Intuitive Equals*** You can stop calling equals() ,replacing it with "==".
6# ***Default Arguments*** 
7# ***Named Arguments***
8# ***The When Expression*** The switch case is replaced with the much more readable and flexible when expression.
9# ***Properties***  Custom set & get behavior can be added to public fields.
10# ***The Data Class***    Unlike in Java it won’t take up 100 lines of code.
11# ***Operator Overloading***   A predefined set of operators can be overloaded to improve readability.
12# ***Destructuring Declarations***  Some objects can be destructured, which is for example useful for iterating maps.
13# ***Ranges***  
14# ***Extension Functions***    In Kotlin,there was a way to add new functions to old classes,such as List and String rather than Util Classes in Java.
15# ***Null Safety*** Java developers have to live in constant fear of NPEs.Kotlin resolves this by distinguishing between non-null types and nullable types.
16# ***Better Lambdas***
17# ***IDE Support***

Summary,in my exeprience,kotlin is similar to another JVM language--scala.
Both languages are more concise,but kotlin is easier to read and write than scala.
So I will try to use it in my next project.

# ***Tip***
We developers like to write codes when we want to meet the needs.But sometimes we do not  have to write actual codes.It's helpful when we can meet the needs by using tools.
Last week,I was told to extract some data from two MYSQL databases and combine the two tables from two databases ,and make some transformation finally write the results into the Mongodb.
I can do it by writing codes ,but since I was learning Pentaho Kettle recently,I  want to try to finish the task by using Pentaho Kettle.After solving few problems I finally finished the task with Pentaho Kettle.Here is what I created by Pentaho Kettle Spoon.

The benifits of using tool instead of writing code,is that the needs may change often,it's easy to adjust it in tool rather that changing codes.

Last week I was preparing a technology sharing in my company.It's about an OLAP Engine for big data called Apache Kylin.I recorded my sharing procedure  serval times after work after the sharing,finally,a 104 minutes' video sharing was done.I uploaded the recorded video to baiduyunpan, Here is the video made by myself,making it public so that anyone interested in this can feel free to watch and download it.Any questions about this sharing are invited.
