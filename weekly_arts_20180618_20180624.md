## ***Two Sum***
### Description
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

### Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
### My Solution In Java
```
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        int[] res = new int[2];
        for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i++){
            for(int j=i+1;j<nums.length;j++){
                if(nums[i]+nums[j] == target){
                    res[0] = i;
                    res[1] = j;
                    return res;
                }
            }
        }
        throw new RuntimeException("no suitable elements for given target!");
    }
}
```
### Analyse
my solution is simple,exactly same idea with [Approach 1: Brute Force] in  the [solution tab] given by leecode,just loop through each element xx and find if there is another value that equals to (target-x).
I found that there are more effiective ways to solve this problem by introducing a hash table, the hash table maintains a mapping of each element in the array to its index,which can reduce the look up time from O(n) to O(1) by trading space for speed.Here is the code,which is more effictive than my solution,especialy when the array is large.
```
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
        }
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("No two sum solution");
}
```

### ***My Review***
```
The artical has 4 outstanding subtitles supporting the artical's goal,for instance, "Not every code is worth writing","Not every bug is worth fixing","Not every command is worth scripting","Not every feature is worth coding".Through the author's exeprience and thinking,he tells the develper that his purpose and the purpose of the code he write is to generate value and make the existing world a better place, not to satisfy your egocentric view of what the world should be.
